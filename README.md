# Jaden Huang

I am a **React developer** and began learning **Angular** two weeks prior to this project.
Please change the `size` prop for `<app-card>` in _invest.html_ to see the other variants.

## Design Assumptions

- **Negative values** on the instrument component use a different colour.
- Spacing is applied using a standardised top margin across all visual elements for consistency.
- The `type` component displays in **uppercase**, except when `type === 'stock'`.
- The different sizes of the Card component are variations, rather than responsive designs that scale with the viewport.
- Text within the Card component will not break onto a second line, and will have its `overflow-x` hidden, with the full name displayed as you interact with the card.

## How your components were structured to handle future design updates.

### Type

- For new types, simply add a new class & style.
- _Nice to have:_ Create a type for the types of type, better encapsulation.

### Instrument

- Styling and HTML layout is well structured, easy to understand and flesh out.

### Card

- New card sizes can be added by adding to the size types.
- CSS clearly laid out for each variant

## The data source/API design you created and how it connects to your implementation

- N/A

## Notes

- Would have liked to setup a typography & colour variable file, deprioritised to get the ball rolling.
- Could not source **Universal Sans**, so **Open Sans** was used as a substitute.
- Forgot to ask about using **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** until it was quite late in the project.
  - Code completions were turned **off**.
  - Used mainly for syntax assistance, not problem-solving or solution design.
  - **NOTE**: _AbbreviateNumberPipe_ was generated by ChatGPT.
- **API structure** was deprioritized; the current setup only provides relevant data for the Discover page.
- Ideally, **skeleton components** would have been implemented for loading states.
- Focused heavily on page creation and fine tuning the UI early on, which limited time for later development.
- Work has only accounted for smaller viewports, developed at **320px** (In my opinion, the smallest relevant viewport size).
- Unfamiliar with the Ionic framework.

## Post 4th hour

I would have focused on:

- Implementing the Discover page using **Ionicâ€™s `ion-searchbar`** with custom styling.
- Buidling the form for purchasing.
- Completed the **full animation sequence**
